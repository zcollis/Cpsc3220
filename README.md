*Unfinished*

Program to simulate a concurrent multi-threaded file buffer cache. Nodes are used to represent memory blocks which are read to buffer cache and written to disk. Disk is implemented as an array, and cache is implemented as a linked list using a Least Recently Used algorithm for evicting cached blocks.
